Machine learning models, including Linear Regression (LR), Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), and Huber Regressor (HR), were employed to develop a predictive framework for PF optimization. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as R^2 (0.9829 for LR, 0.9827 for RANSAC, and 0.9824 for HR), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), demonstrating their high predictive accuracy. The findings highlight the capability of machine learning to improve blasting control, reduce environmental impacts, and promote sustainable mining practices. By integrating artificial intelligence into mining operations, this study advances the concept of intelligent mining, offering innovative solutions that enhance operational efficiency while fostering environmental stewardship.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-00983-8_6
10.1007/978-3-032-02929-4_9,Discovering Comprehensive Branched Declarative Process Constraints,"The more nuanced the declarative process constraints discovered from an event log, the more likely they are to capture meaningful business knowledge, thus fostering the application of declarative process modeling in practice. Branching the activation (source) or the target of the constraints, that is, allowing more than one event type to appear as the source or the target, is a typical way to increase their expressivity. For the discovery of Declare constraints, only the case of branching the constraint target considering the inclusive disjunction policy has been considered. In this paper, we present CBDeclare , a comprehensive approach to branched declarative process constraints, contributing in two key dimensions. First, we define a semantics of both source- and target-branched Declare constraints considering different branching policies. Second, we devise methods to discover the newly defined Declare constraint types from an event log. Our solution leverages the SIESTA framework’s scalable and incremental infrastructure for event processing, achieving significant performance gains in mining these extended constraint when compared to the solutions for target-branched constraint discovery available in the literature.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02929-4_9

We study the complete pattern mining problem for Simon’s congruence, where the problem is to find the substrings of a given text  $$\texttt{T}$$ T that maximizes the number of congruent substrings of the text, for each possible value of k . We design new data structures that capture the equivalence classes with respect to $$\sim _k$$ ∼ k for substrings of the text. We then propose an $$O(|\texttt{T}|^2\log ^2|\texttt{T}|)$$ O ( | T | 2 log 2 | T | ) -time algorithm for fixed-sized alphabets using the new data structures.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-01475-7_13
10.1007/978-981-96-2771-4_1,Research on Vulnerability Mining Technology of Electric Power Industrial Control Equipment Based on Genetic Algorithm,"The traditional vulnerability mining methods for information systems require prior knowledge of protocol specifications, which often necessitates developers to invest significant time in learning and comprehending the protocol format for effective development of vulnerability mining test cases. However, in the power industry, industrial control equipment utilizes a multitude of private protocols with undisclosed specifications (unknown protocols). Consequently, the conventional vulnerability mining technology based on prior knowledge cannot be directly applied to these unknown industrial control protocols. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method and system of fuzzy testing for industrial control equipment based on genetic algorithms. The objective is to resolve challenges such as prolonged development periods, inability to test unknown protocols, and low efficiency in conducting vulnerability mining tests on unknown protocol vulnerabilities within industrial control equipment.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-96-2771-4_1
10.1007/978-3-031-96841-9_2,Analyzing Side-Tracking of Developers Using Object-Centric Process Mining,"Managers need to analyze the software development process to pro-actively make decisions that meet quality, budget and time objectives. To aid this analysis, a number of data-driven approaches exist, which can be used for specific purposes, such as computing target key performance indicators (KPIs). In particular, process analysis techniques, like process mining, can analyze data from event logs of information systems and deliver actionable insights on how the process is conducted. However, traditional process mining techniques make strong assumptions on the structure of event logs, requiring the existence of a case identifier, used to group the traces. As a result, the output of such techniques only provides a narrow view of the reality, leading the manager towards wrong interpretations in cases of side-tracking , when a developer is involved in different processes that interleave one another. To account for these cases, we investigate the use of object-centric process mining (OCPM) to analyze software repositories. Our results help to explain performance issues by revealing the contributing factors that hinder the progress of development tasks.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-96841-9_2
10.1007/978-3-032-02515-9_21,In Search of Digital Talent: Evidence from Public Sector Job Advertisements in Germany Using LLM-Enabled Competence Classification,"The public sector continues to struggle with the digital transformation of its organizations, lagging behind the private sector in implementing digital processes and services. A key success factor is the availability of appropriate digital skills in the workforce. This can be enhanced by training existing staff or hiring skilled individuals. In the latter scenario, the hiring process must focus on the required competencies. Typically, job advertisements are used to communicate job requirements. his article explores the presence of digital competencies in job ads of German public organizations. We operationalize the DigComp 2.2 framework as a category system to identify required digital competences in these job advertisements. To assess a large volume of job postings, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) for categorization. In this way, we are able to process 5,949 job advertisements. Results indicate frequent mentions of skills related to digital content creation and data handling, while communication, problem-solving, and safety are rarely highlighted. Although the reasons for this are not explicitly identified in our study, a mismatch is evident between the push for digital transformation in the public sector and the recruitment practices reflected in job advertisements.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02515-9_21
10.1007/978-3-031-93802-3_1,A Comprehensive Overview of Graph Convolutional Network,"A graph convolutional network (GCN) is a neural network explicitly developed for processing graph-structured data input. Graph-structured data is represented as a graph, with each node denoting an entity and each edge signifying a relationship between two entities. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are applicable to numerous tasks involving graph-structured data, including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) perform by executing a sequence of convolutional operations on graph data. These convolution techniques resemble those utilized in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), although they are modified to function on graph-structured input. The convolution procedures in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) consider the interconnections among nodes in the graph, enabling GCNs to acquire more intricate features from the graph data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) exhibit efficacy across numerous tasks using graph-structured data. For instance, GCNs have been employed for node classification in social networks, link prediction in recommendation systems, and graph classification in natural language processing. The various types of graph convolution networks like Spatial graph convolutional networks: These networks employ a spatial convolution operation to consolidate the properties of adjacent nodes. Spectral graph convolutional networks: These networks employ a spectral convolution process, which is more potent yet computationally intensive. Message passing neural networks: These networks are a variant of graph convolutional networks (GCN) that employs a message passing mechanism to consolidate the features of adjacent nodes. In graph computation, GCNs denote the application of a spatially moving filter across the nodes of a graph, which contains embeddings or data pertinent to each node, to derive a feature representation for each node. Information from bigger neighbourhoods can also be integrated by stacking many convolutional layers, akin to the construction of a conventional CNN.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93802-3_1
10.1007/978-3-031-93601-2_21,Data Science Techniques for Opinion Mining in Industrial Applications,"Opinion mining is a crucial research area in data science that focuses on the automatic analysis of textual data (such as reviews, customer comments, and feedback) to identify and evaluate sentiments expressed. In industrial contexts, it plays a vital role in enhancing customer feedback analysis, optimizing predictive maintenance, and improving process efficiency. In this research, we propose an innovative opinion mining method that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), domain ontologies, and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to assist managers in making informed decisions about their products and services. Our method begins by constructing domain-specific ontologies, which play a key role in aspect detection within user comments. We then collect a raw dataset from social media platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook, focusing on four domains: Tunisian restaurants, smartphones, the 2019 Tunisian elections, and Tunisian TV programs. This dataset undergoes multiple pre-processing steps, including transliteration, stop-word removal, and vectorization, to prepare it for analysis. To classify sentiments, we employ two advanced deep learning models (i.e., LSTM and Bi-GRU), which are applied to analyze both the overall sentiment of each comment and the sentiment associated with specific aspects. This dual-layer analysis provides a detailed understanding of user opinions, identifying whether sentiments are positive, negative, or neutral at both the comment and aspect levels. This work not only advances the field of opinion mining through the integration of ontologies and deep learning but also offers valuable practical implications for decision-making in a wide range of industrial applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93601-2_21
10.1007/978-981-96-6594-5_12,MLLM-Driven Semantic Enhancement and Alignment for Text-Based Person Search,"Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) seeks to accurately locate target pedestrian images within extensive image databases by leveraging natural language descriptions, with the primary challenge centered around achieving cross-modal semantic alignment. Textual descriptions in existing datasets frequently lack sufficient semantic detail to fully represent the content of pedestrian images, resulting in semantic imbalance that significantly hampers the performance of TBPS models. To mitigate this issue, we fine-tune the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) specifically for the TBPS task, utilizing its robust generative capabilities to enrich the semantic content of the text. However, MLLM faces the challenges of visual illusions and potential semantic mismatches in applications. To this end, we propose the Constrained Semantic Augmentation Module (CSAM) and the Influential Semantic Mining Module (ISMM). CSAM filters mismatched information through explicit semantic filtering to improve data quality and reliability; ISMM achieves precise local fine-grained semantic alignment by adaptively extracting and integrating influential semantic features across heterogeneous modalities, effectively reducing the impact of irrelevant information. Experimental results on various TBPS benchmark datasets show that our method significantly improves multiple evaluation metrics and effectively addresses the challenges of semantic imbalance.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-96-6594-5_12
